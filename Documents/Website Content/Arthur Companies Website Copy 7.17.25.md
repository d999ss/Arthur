**Subhead:** 100 years in the field—and we're just getting started.

**Intro Paragraph:**  
Every day, farmers across the Northern Plains rely on Arthur for more than just market access and inputs. They count on us for straight answers, honest service, and solutions that work.

### Section: For Growers
You know your acres. We know the market. Our team shows up, answers the phone, and competes to earn your business whether you're hauling to an Arthur elevator, planning for next year with our agronomy experts, or growing under contract for specialty end-users.

### Section: Who We Are
Since 1906, we've built relationships that last. What began as a single elevator in Arthur, ND, has grown into a multi-state operation supporting thousands of acres.

We pioneered fertilizer use in North Dakota, powered our town before the grid reached it, and reinvested earnings into seed genetics, new facilities, and next-generation technology. Today, our fourth-generation family business is still taking the next hill on behalf of the growers and partners who put their trust in us.

**CTAs:** [About Us]

**Testimonial or Highlight (Optional):** "Arthur is the kind of company that shows up when it matters. We count on them every year, and every year they deliver." — Grower, Cass County

## PRODUCTS & SERVICES
**Header:** Products & Services

**Subhead:** Arthur delivers the inputs, expertise, and supply chain strength to help growers produce high-quality crops—and to help partners source them with confidence.

### On the Farm
At Arthur, agronomy isn't a sideline—it's a service.

Our team doesn't just sell what's on the shelf. We scout, we test, and we stand behind our recommendations because we've put them through the paces—on the farm, in our own trials, and across the acres we serve. With tools like precision mapping, variable-rate application, and local yield data, we help you make every pass count.

We don't push programs. We build plans. That means putting your return ahead of our margin and earning trust the old-fashioned way: handshakes.

From seed selection to crop protection to timing your inputs, we're in your corner—backed by a century of experience, a commitment to good science, and a belief that the best agronomy is local.

* Agronomy Centers: Strategically located agronomy hubs with deep product inventory and trusted crop advisors. [Link out to page featuring services -- research & development, soil testing, mapping, scouting]
* Crop Inputs: A full lineup of leading seed, crop protection, and nutrition products. [Link out to page featuring products we carry]
* Custom Application & Trucking: Timely, efficient, and precise application of crop nutrients and protection. Trucking that's available when and where you need it. [Link out to page featuring aerial, ground, spreading, trucking services]

### Off the Farm
Arthur's work doesn't end at the field's edge. We invest in businesses that take crops further—transforming raw grain into food and pet food ingredients, building traceable supply chains, and supplying wholesale inputs that keep the entire system running.

* Premium Ingredients: We supply food and pet food manufacturers with premium grain ingredients, backed by rigorous quality assurance. [Link out to Anchor Ingredients]
* Pet Food Manufacturing: Arthur operates a U.S.-based co-manufacturer that produces premium freeze-dried pet food and treats for today's top brands. [Link out to North Freeze Dry]
* Specialty Crops: From flax to barley and sunflowers to canola, Arthur manages specialty crop contracts to help growers move their commodity and producers source quality product. [Link out to page on specialty crops]
* Wholesale Fertilizer: Source wholesale bulk fertilizer from modern facilities in Carrington and Berthold, North Dakota. [Link out to AgResource]
* Trading: Arthurs' unique platform and close relationships with growers and suppliers across the northern tier of the U.S. put us in a position to supply a wide variety of customers. [Link to page about trading operation]
* Research & Development: Through Arthur's R&D platform, we conduct replicated trials and field-scale custom research to validate performance and return on investment. [Link out to page about Frontier and Latitude 47]

## INNOVATION
**Header:** Innovation in the Field

**Subhead:** We believe better tools, stronger genetics, and quality data advances the future of agriculture—for growers, buyers, and the land.

### Venture Platform
Before most businesses had even touched a keyboard, Arthur was backing software that would change the way industries operated. In the early 1990s, we were the sole owner of Great Plains Software, a company that revolutionized accounting systems for small and midsize businesses. That venture went public and ultimately became the backbone of what is now Microsoft Dynamics.

It wasn't just a good investment—it was a signal of how we think: long-term, systems-focused, and unafraid to bet on what's next.

Today, that mindset continues to guide our innovation platform. We don't chase buzzwords. We back ideas that solve real problems in agriculture, logistics, and finance because better tools build better businesses, and better businesses support stronger farms.

[Feature Tiles on each of the current investments – SeedZ, Levridge, Balcão, Ag Startup Engine, EpiCrop]

### Why We Invest Differently
Arthur's venture platform isn't structured around exits or fund cycles. We're a family-owned operating company that invests where we see long-term value—not just financial upside. If a tool helps growers farm smarter, or helps ag businesses run cleaner, we get involved. We back companies where our experience, reach, and reputation can move the needle beyond capital alone.

* Rooted Perspective: As operators in the ag value chain, we spot what actually works—not just what sounds good in a pitch deck.
* Long-Term Alignment: We've worked with some farm families for four generations. We value patient growth, not manufactured outcomes.
* Built-In Reach: Our footprint in grain, agronomy, and ingredients means we can help test, scale, and distribute the right ideas at the right time.
* Real-World Insight: We bring field-tested, boots-on-the-ground experience to help entrepreneurs sharpen, simplify, and scale their solutions.

## ABOUT
**Header:** Who We Are

**Subhead:** Arthur is a family-owned agribusiness with over a century of history and a clear focus on the future. Our company is built on relationships, results, and doing things the right way.

[A look at our history – Link to history page]

### The Arthur Advantage
Agriculture needs more than efficiency. It needs options.

That's what The Arthur Companies has offered for over a century: a real alternative. We're not a co-op. We're not a corporate. We're a family-owned, professionally run agribusiness platform competing in markets where competition is disappearing.

As the industry consolidates and decisions drift further from the farm, Arthur stays rooted. We reinvest locally, move quickly, and deliver value from inputs to end-use—all without asking growers to give up their independence.

Our mission is to enable prosperity for our customers and our communities. Our model makes that possible and our values keep us focused on earning that trust year after year.

### OUR PURPOSE
To enable growth and prosperity with our customers and our communities by providing competitive markets, superior products, and dependable experts that deliver exceptional service.

### OUR VALUES

**GROWTH**  
Whether it's our customers' businesses or expanding our service footprint, growth is integral to who we are and where we're headed. We believe growth is a choice, and seeding growth is at the core of everything we do. This mindset guides every decision we make.

**SERVICE**  
Consistency where it counts — our foundation was built on our dedication to serving growers, team members, and our communities. We seek to provide value in every interaction we have with all of our stakeholders.

**INTEGRITY**  
Do it the right way every time — it's the best way to gain respect and how we've been able to maintain our loyal customer base for over a century. If a job is worth doing, it's worth doing it right the first time.

**TRUST**  
We do not take trust for granted; our team knows that we must earn trust every single day by striving for excellence in all we do. We earn trust by consistently doing what we say we will do.

**PIONEERING**  
Trailblazing isn't a culture we created, it's something we inherited and strive for in all aspects of our business. We are not satisfied with the status quo and are committed to creating new opportunities and higher levels of service.

## CAREERS
**Header:** Grow With Us

[handwritten letter from CEO]

You spend a good part of your life working.  
So the work needs to matter. And the people ought to care.  
At Arthur, we don't have fancy offices or flashy conferences.  
What we do have is a business built over four generations  
by people who show up, take ownership, and take pride in what they do.  
We serve farmers. We move grain.  
We build real systems, launch new ventures,  
and support each other when the job's tough.  
The work is meaningful because the outcomes are real.  
We don't care much about where you went to school  
or what your last title was.  
If you're good at what you do—and willing to give a damn—  
you'll fit right in.  

Let's get to work,  
—James
