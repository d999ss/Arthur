# Project Brief

### **Project Overview**

The Arthur Companies is a fourth-generation, family-owned agribusiness based in North

Dakota. 

We're redesigning their website to serve two distinct audiences:

1. **Farmers** – practical users who need daily access to grain pricing, services, and

2. updates.

**Corporate Visitors** – including business partners, vendors, acquirers, and

stakeholders who want to understand our values, leadership, and performance.

The new website must:

- Be fast, mobile-friendly, and useful to growers.
- Be credible, well-crafted, and strategically positioned for institutional audiences.

### **Primary Objectives**

- Create a site that serves as a daily utility for growers (grain prices, hours,

weather/service alerts).

- Showcase our brand, values, leadership, and track record for corporate

stakeholders.

- Reflect a modern agribusiness that is local in heart, but national in capability.
- Simplify navigation and content to prioritize clarity and usefulness.
- Position the company for growth: new services, R&D, acquisitions, hiring.

### **Audience Profiles**

1. Farmers (Growers)

- Device: Mobile
- Needs: Grain prices, service hours, quick updates, clear contact
- Behavior: In and out quickly, habitual users
- Design Implication: Strip away friction. Prioritize accessibility and performance.

2. Corporate Visitors (Partners / Acquisition Targets / Vendors)

- Device: Desktop
- Needs: Company story, scale, structure, values, leadership, innovation
- Behavior: Browse multiple pages, research-oriented
- Design Implication: Professional polish, credible structure, strong copy and visuals.

### **Design Direction**

Brand Attributes to Convey

![Screenshot 2025-07-17 at 7.34.06 AM.png](Project%20Brief%20232b987d66268003b18ed8ae20b428d9/Screenshot_2025-07-17_at_7.34.06_AM.png)

**Design Feel**

- Visual Mood: Open, grounded, timeless, confident.
- Imagery: Use real photos—team, trucks, bins, fields. Avoid stock farm clichés.
- Tone: Straightforward, honest, neighborly but not unsophisticated.
- Typography:
    - Headlines: Heavy, legacy nod with modern flair
    - Body: Clean, light and easy to read

**Color Palette**

Align toward core brand colors:

- Yellow Primary: Pantone 1235
- Supporting Yellows: Pantone 1445, 153
- Greys/Black: Pantone Cool Gray 11, Process Black
- Accent Whites/Light Grays to maintain openness and contrast

**Photography**

- Use AI to fill in blank spaces. Leverage these brand photos as you’re able.
- Note that we’ll be doing a full brand shoot in the first week of September and will shoot to fill the site as we need. Design for what we want, not just what we have.

Making Ag Look Cool

- Arthur is doing really innovative things in research and development. It should look/feel that way.
- The equipment used across the businesses in this platform are impressive machines and feats of engineering. I want the imagery to pop off the page when we talk about custom services like [aerial spraying](https://airtractor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Aero-Applicators_Sterling-CO_0165.jpg), [fertilizer application](https://parallelag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/terragator.webp), [ground spraying](https://blog.machinefinder.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/john-deere-sprayer.jpg), [trucking](https://www.cornhusker800.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/tandem-1-scaled.jpg), etc.

**Functionality Requirements**

**Content + Copy Notes**

- Voice = confident, direct, humble.
- Avoid “marketing speak.” Write like you’d explain things to a respected neighbor.
- Use subheadlines and bullet points—readability is essential.
- Assume corporate visitors are intelligent but unfamiliar; assume farmers are busy and informed.

### Inspiration sites

[Great Dane](https://greatdane.com/refrigerated/everest/)

[https://www.andersonsinc.com/about-us/history/](https://www.andersonsinc.com/about-us/history/)
The flow of this history tab is clean and impactful; like the use of
oversized outline text; can apply that elsewhere. The cream colors
here help balance the use of strong primary colors like yellow.
Callout text is also clean.

[https://www.cargill.com/about](https://www.cargill.com/about)

Clean layout, I like the use of rounded corners. Typeface is
approachable. Good layout of executive team.

[https://www.sequoiacap.com](https://www.sequoiacap.com/)
We like the use of the “pen” throughout this design. Feels genuine
yet still professional.

[https://bushelpowered.com](https://bushelpowered.com/)
Menu system here is strong and would allow us to list most grain
locations within the dropdown.

[https://www.firstwestern.bank/locations/](https://www.firstwestern.bank/locations/)
Ignore design here but this is a good way to layout multiple
locations.

[https://www.apple.com/newsroom/](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/)
Like the look of this for newsroom CMS

[https://www.getharvest.com/careers](https://www.getharvest.com/careers)
Great layout for careers page but we’d want a bit more visual
interest or iconography to break up text

[https://www.veed.io/careers](https://www.veed.io/careers) 

Similar to Sequoia I like this sort of “no
nonsense” letter from the CEO in handwriting to open the careers
page.

- We need this page to be viewable in Spanish
- Look to Apple for the careers page as well. We want to compel
people to work here. Be part of something. Feel it / move them. Go
lighter on copy than harvest while leaning on their layout.
